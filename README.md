## What is <u>Christmas<u> ?

**_Christmas_** is a major Christian festival on **_December 25th_** celebrating the birth of _Jesus Christ_ , marked by religious services, gift-giving, feasting, and traditions like decorated trees, but it's also a widespread cultural festival for many non-Christians, blending spiritual reflection with secular customs of goodwill and family gatherings. The name **"Christmas"** comes from **_"Christ's Mass"_**...

## Why do some people call it as _"Xmas"_ ?

_**"Xmas"**_ is a shorthand for Christmas, where the **"X"** stands for **_Chi (Χ)_**, the first letter of the _**Greek word for Christ**_ ( Khristós )

It's a traditional abbreviation, used for centuries to save space!
